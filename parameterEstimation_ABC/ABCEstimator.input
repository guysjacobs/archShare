//	Calculates the tukey depth P-value. This calculates the Tukey depth (the minimum number of sample points on one side of a hyperplane through the point, i.e. a measure of how centered a point is in an overall cloud of points) of the observed data and contrasts it with the Tukey depth of the distribution of all retained simulation points (hence argument should be equal or less than numRetained), to produce a p-value. If the observed point is close to the center of the retained simulations, we expect that most

//	Posterior estimation settings
//	Since ABCestimator standardizes the parameters internally to the range [0, 1] diracPeakWidth, the same diracPeakWidth value is used for all parameters. Too small values of diracPeakWidth will result in wiggly posterior curves, too large values might unduly smear out the curves. The best advice is to run the calculations with several choices for diracPeakWidth. The choice of diracPeakWidth depends on the number of retained simulations: the larger the number of retained parameter values, the sharper the smaller diracPeakWidth can be cho- sen in order to still get a rather smooth result. If the parameter diracPeakWidth is not defined, ABCestimator uses as value of 0.001, unless the parameter numRetained is defined. In this case ABCestimator sets Ïƒk = 1/N, where N is the number of simulations to retain, as proposed by Leuenberger and Wegmann (2009). Update: it seems that ABCtoolbox always defaults to 0.001, regardless of if numRetained is defined or not.
